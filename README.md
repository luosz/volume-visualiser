Volume Visualiser is an enhanced version of Volume Renderer (https://bitbucket.org/lsz/volume-renderer), which is a volume rendering program based on VTK and Qt.
Volume Visualiser can handle multiple volume data sets as well as time-varying volume data sets.
It uses the vtkSlicerGPURayCastVolumeMapper from Slicer (https://www.slicer.org/) to render volume data and widgets from CTK (www.commontk.org) to display the properties of volume data.

** 2016-11-13 Update: The project has been updated and successfully built with CMake 3.7, VTK 7.1, Qt 5.7 and Visual Studio 2015. **

** 2015-09-14 Update: The CTK widgets in this project are only a small subset of the CTK library downloaded on 14 September 2015 from https://github.com/commontk/CTK **
